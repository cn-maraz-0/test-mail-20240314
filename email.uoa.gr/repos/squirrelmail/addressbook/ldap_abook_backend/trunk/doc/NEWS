    * ACL examples in the documentation.

    * Improved error messages.

    * Can validate email address.

    * UTF-8 encoding and decoding of LDAP attribute names and values.

    * Can use special characters in nickname (and DN). 
      Characters that can appear in nickname: ,;<>+\"

    * Protocol LDAPv3 is the default from now.

0.2pre1	2005-04-10

    * Debug log.

    * Improved i18n.

    * Hungarian translation.

    * LDAP options ($ldapAbookOptions) expects options names as strings
      instead of PHP constant names.

    * Dedicated address book container object (plugin automatically creates
      missing container object).

    * Self auth mode works.

    * Modifying entry works without recreating the object, it also preserves
      those attributes that does not belong to SM. It even works when rename
      is necessary. In that case first it creates the new object and deletes
      the old one only if add was successful.

    * Many minor bug-fixes.
