Installing Plugin
=================

1 ) Simply untar the file in the plugins directory, and make sure it is in its
    own directory, and that the name of the directory is the name of the
    plugin.

        # cd plugins
        # tar -zxvf ldap_abook_backend.0.2.2-1.4.5.tar.gz

2 ) Version before 1.4.5 requires patching for address book hooks. Go to the main
    directory of your SquirrelMail installation and the apply
    addressbook.php.patch.

	# cd /path/to/squirrelmail
	$ patch -p1 <plugins/ldap_abook_backend/addressbook.php.patch

3 ) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose option 8 and add
    the plugin.  Save and exit, then that should be all if the plugin was made
    correctly.  :)

        # cd ../config
        # ./conf.pl

4 ) Download and install ldap_common plugin. It should not be enabled via
    conf.pl, but the plugins/ldap_common directory should exist, since common
    files will be included from there.

5 ) Create and edit your own config.php

        # cd ldap_abook_backend
        # cp config_sample.php config.php 

6 ) You should decide if a manager account will be used to access Personal
    Addressbook Entries in LDAP, or the plugin binds with the found mail account
    object's DN and password. This is configurable via the $ldapAbookUseSelfAuth
    parameter in config.php.

    Dedicated manager account is a good choice if your users can access the LDAP
    server directly, but you don't want them to modify Addressbook from outside.
    The drawback of a dedicated manager account is that its password should be
    stored in config.php.

    Read SECURITY file for ACL examples.

    Don't forget to restart your LDAP server after modifying ACL!
