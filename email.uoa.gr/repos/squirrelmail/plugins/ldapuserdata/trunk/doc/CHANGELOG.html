<h2>Changelog</h2>


<h3>0.5svn</h3>

<ul>

<li>Cleaner implementation; does not need much fiddling with Squirrelmail's
files.</li>

<li>Uses prefs_backend plugin hook for easier integration with
Squirrelmail.</li>

<li>New option to remove the options that are not saved in LDAP. No patch of
Squirrelmail option files is needed.</li>

<li>Squirrelmail schema has been updated. Specifically:

<ul>
<li>Newmail plugin configuration added to attributes</li>
<li>Added composeWindowType to attributes, for html_mail plugin
configuration.</li>
<li>The highlight preferences are now a single-value attribute which is
produced by serialization of the relevant Squirrelmail variables.</li>
<li>POP Fetch variables are also serialized, which will result in less
corrupted data being saved and read back.</li>
<li>Official, registered to IANA, unique OIDs are used instead of the temporary
random ones.</li>
<li>Added attributes for preview_pane plugin.</li>
<li>Added a generic multivalue attribute, smOptions, for any other setting, so
no further schema changes will be needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>

previously supported mailAlternateAddress, for the LDAP identities.</li>
