<h2>What?</h2>

<p>
The <em>javascript_libs</em> plugin is a Squirrelmail &quot;library&quot;
plugin that allows Squirrelmail plugin developers to easily take advantage and
make use of popular javascript libraries and frameworks.  </p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://email.uoa.gr/projects/squirrelmail/avelsieve.php">Sieve
    Mail filters plugin (avelsieve)</a> was in need of some usability
improvements and UI effects. These had to be done as an option, so that the UI
would degrade nicely if a browser would not support Javascript. Thus,
javascript_libs was born.</p>

<p>And because other plugin authors might want to take advantage of the
plugin's feature, in order to take advantage of Javascript frameworks or
introduce Javascript effects themselves, this small piece of documentation was
written and the plugin is released properly.</p>


<h2>A Guide to Users / Administrators</h2>

<p>Simply untar the plugin under your Squirrelmail plugins/ directory and
enable it in Squirrelmail configuration.</p>


<h2>A Guide to Plugin Authors / Developers</h2>

<h3>Purpose / Motivation</h3>

<p>The purpose of the plugin is to:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Provide some popular javascript libraries and frameworks (prototype,
scriptaculous, lightbox) in an easy to install squirrelmail plugin
package.</li>

<li>Provide plugins or Squirrelmail core code, with a function that they
can use to enable the usage of such a library / framework very easily.
How easily you say?<br/>
<br/>
This easily:
<br/>
<pre name="code" class="php">
javascript_libs_register('src/read_body.php', array('prototype-1.6.0/prototype.js','scriptaculous/scriptaculous.js'));
</pre>

</li>
<li>Handle some basic dependencies between libraries. For instance, if a
plugin wants to use scriptaculous, then <tt>prototype.js</tt> is also included.</li>

<li>Allow two or more plugins to use the same javascript
files / libraries, in the same page, but in the end include them only
once.</li>

</ul>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>All is accomplished by a simple hook called <tt>javascript_libs_register</tt>.</p>

<p>In your plugin's setup.php, you need to do two things:</p>

<p>In the plugin register function, make a hook to a custom function:</p>

<pre name="code" class="php">
function squirrelmail_plugin_init_example_plugin() {
    global $squirrelmail_plugin_hooks;
    $squirrelmail_plugin_hooks['javascript_libs_register']['example_plugin'] = 'image_lightbox_register';
    /* Other plugin hooks... */
}
</pre>

<p>And then, create the corresponding function, which should look like this:</p>

<pre name="code" class="php">
function example_plugin_register_jslibs() {
    global $plugins;
    if(in_array('javascript_libs', $plugins)) {
        javascript_libs_register('plugins/example_plugin/script.php', array('prototype-1.6.0/prototype.js','scriptaculous/scriptaculous.js'));
        javascript_libs_register('src/right_main.php', array('prototype-1.6.0/prototype.js'));
    }
}
</pre>


<p>The javascript_libs_register() takes two arguments:</p>
<ul>
    <li>string <strong>$page</strong> - the path of the PHP script, starting
    from squirrelmail base directory, where the javascript library will be
    enabled.</li>

    <li>array <strong>$javascripts</strong> - a relative pathname of the javascript
    file, starting from the directory <tt>plugins/javascript_libs/modules</tt>
    For instance, <tt>'prototype-1.6.0/prototype.js'</tt> .
</ul>



<h2>Future Work and Ideas</h2>

<p>The javascript_libs plugin is focusing toward usage of plugins in the
Squirrelmail stable (1.4) branch. The development branch of Squirrelmail,
1.5.x, has implemented templating. So, if certain javascript functionality is
desired, especially across many pages of the Squirrelmail interface, it would
be best to create or extend the actual templates themselves.</p>

<p>However, when the 1.5.x tree grows up to more widespread usage, and if the
usage of javascript_libs is becoming popular among plugins, it is expected that
this plugin will work nicely in Squirrelmail 1.5.x too, in a backward-compatible way.</p>

<h2>TODO</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Use Pear::Cache_Lite to cache the minified javascripts.</li>
    <li>Propertly port / adapt to Squirrelmail 1.5 and its template logic.</li>
</ul>
