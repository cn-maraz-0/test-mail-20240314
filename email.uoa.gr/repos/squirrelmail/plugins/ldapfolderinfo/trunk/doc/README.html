<h2><em>ldapfolderinfo</em> Squirrelmail Plugin</h2>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
<em>ldapfolderinfo</em> is a Squirrelmail plugin and patchset that is essential
to the <a href="http://email.uoa.gr/overview/">email.uoa.gr Mail Project</a>.
Based on the<a href="http://email.uoa.gr/projects/cyrus/">Cyrus patches</a> and <a
href="http://email.uoa.gr/projects/cyrusmaster/">Cyrusmaster</a> Cyrus
administration tool, it provides a wealth of information about mail folders and
their users and administrators to end users. It also allows them to easily post
to a folder through the webmail interface.

places.</li>
