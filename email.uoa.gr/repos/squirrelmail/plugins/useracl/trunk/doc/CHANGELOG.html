<h3>2.2.1 svn </h3>

<ul>
    <li>Smaller setup.php file, using sq_change_text_domain(), index.php files

<ul>
    <li>In the popup window (<tt>addacl.php</tt>), the
    <tt>$useracl_only_inbox</tt> config flag was not honored, and also all
    folders were displayed in the listbox, instead of only the ones where
    changing ACL is possible. This is fixed, as the mailbox list routine has
    been made a function (<tt>useracl_mailbox_list()</tt>)</li>

    <li>Added functions <tt>is_user_folder()</tt>, <tt>is_personal_folder()</tt> and
    <tt>is_shared_folder()</tt>, even though support for using NAMESPACE to
    determine the relevant status is not yet complete.</li>

    <li>Cleanups - remove ldap.php, remove function name collision with 'directory' plugin.</li>

    <li>Small typo - <tt>&amp;nbsp</tt> instead of <tt>&amp;nbsp;</tt> </li>

    <li>Error handling argument in backend IMAP ACL functions.</li>

    Folders page etc.)</li>

    <li>Fixed wrongly inserted message in email notification (&quot;For more
    information about shared folders, please see  .&quot;).</li>

    <li>Updated some icons to more good-looking ones, and fixed their
    alignment. (Some icons courtesy of <a

    <li>Uses Squirrelmail token functions for form validation, to prevent CSRF attacks.</li>
