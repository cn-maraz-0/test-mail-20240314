Avelsieve Script Management: Package "admin-utils".
===================================================

The 'utils' scripts are PHP-CLI scripts intended to be used
by administrators or power users, and are used for migration of
users' rules, statistics extraction and other batch jobs.

THESE SCRIPTS ARE PROVIDED WITH NO SUPPORT.

You might need to edit many of these scripts to make them
useful to you. They are only provided here only for guidance
and in case they might be useful to someone.

Quick run-down on how to use a script:

1) Read the script code.

2) Adjust accordingly.

3) Put a list of usernames in usernames/<filename>.

4) Copy utils_global_config_sample.php to utils_global_config.php and edit
accordingly.

5) Edit avelsieve file:
  ../include/support.inc.php
 and comment out the line:
 //include_once(SM_PATH . 'functions/identity.php');
 
[When you are done, and if this is the local installation of Squirrelmail in
your administration machine, put it back for normal avelsieve operation :-p]


6) Do a test run. e.g.

 $ php5 ./migrate_11_11newtests.php

 or 

 $ php5 ./migrate_11_11newtests.php > logs/testrun.txt

 and study the results to see if they are OK.

7) Back up your users' Sieve scripts.

8) Uncomment the "Production run" snippet in migrate_*.php script and do a
production run.
