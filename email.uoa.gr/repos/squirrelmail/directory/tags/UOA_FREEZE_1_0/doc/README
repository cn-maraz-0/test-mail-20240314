                   Directory Service Plugin for Squirrelmail

   Brent Bice (bbice at persistence .com) originally wrote the much
   famous [1]ldapquery plugin for Squirrelmail; a plugin for searching
   LDAP for users.

   This is a plugin with the same functionality, highly based on Brent's
   code, with the following additional features:
     * Squirrelmail 1.4.x compatibility, guidelines compatible
     * Supports extra information display about an organizational unit.
     * LDAP Schemas (Definitions of the various attributes) are stored in
       separate files and can be extended easily.
     * Supports the eduOrg and eduPerson schemas, as defined by the
       Internet2 Middleware, Architecture Committee, Directory Working
       Group (MACE-Dir).
     * Organizational Units are cached in the session.
     * User can place a restriction filter: the result must belong to the
       organizational unit(s) selected by the user.
     * Supports a kind of interoperability with the [2]Shared Folders
       (useracl) plugin for Squirrelmail: can display a direct link from
       the directory search results, to add a share to a particular user.
     * Adds an option in config.php for the maximum number of results
       that the LDAP server will return. If there are more than the
       maximum results, a nice message is being displayed.
     * Localizable. Template is at po/ldapquery.pot.
     * If a localized entry exists in the LDAP and it matches the user's
       locale, for example: entry cn;lang-fr exists and user has French
       locale, it will use this entry. It first converts from LDAP's UTF8
       to the charset used in Squirrelmail, using mb_string_convert() or
       recode() or iconv(), whichever is available.
     * User can ask for many criteria to be ANDed in the search.
     * Can use an administrator-supplied bind dn & password.
     * uses makeComposeLink() for the mailto: hyperlinks. (Requires
       Squirrelmail 1.4.2)
     * Can display alternate mail addresses if they exist on user's LDAP
       object.
     * Looks really nice, with Squirrelmail colors and tables.

Download

   You can grab the latest sources via anonymous CVS, using this command
   sequence: (Press enter when asked for a password)
   cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@email.uoa.gr:/squirrelmail login
   cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@email.uoa.gr:/squirrelmail co directory

   There is also a [3]ViewCVS Web Interface to the repository.

TODO

     * Finalize some fixes for multiple tables as well (such as
       multilanguage support). Currently only single-table output is
       completed.
     * Clean up and support all the different configurations.
     * Stabilize API for other Squirrelmail applications to pass
       javascript code.
