<h1>Directory Service Plugin for Squirrelmail</h1>

<p><strong>Brent Bice</strong> (bbice at persistence .com) originally wrote the
much famous <a
href="http://www.squirrelmail.org/plugin_view.php?id=42">ldapquery plugin for
Squirrelmail</a>; a plugin for searching LDAP for users.</p>

<p>This is a plugin with the same functionality, highly based on Brent's code,
with the following additional features:</p>

<ul>

<li>Squirrelmail 1.4.x compatibility, guidelines compatible</li>

<li>Supports extra information display about an organizational unit.</li>

<li>LDAP Schemas (Definitions of the various attributes) are stored in separate
files and can be extended easily.</li>

<li>Supports the eduOrg and eduPerson schemas, as defined by the Internet2
Middleware, Architecture Committee, Directory Working Group (MACE-Dir).</li>
 
<li>Organizational Units are cached in the session.</li>

<li>User can place a restriction filter: the result must belong to the
organizational unit(s) selected by the user.</li>

<li> Supports a kind of interoperability with the <a
href="http://email.uoa.gr/projects/squirrelmail/useracl.php">Shared Folders
(useracl) plugin</a> for Squirrelmail: can display a direct link from the
directory search results, to add a share to a particular user.</li>

<li>Adds an option in config.php for the maximum number of results that the
LDAP server will return. If there are more than the maximum results, a nice
message is being displayed.</li>

<li>Localizable. Template is at po/ldapquery.pot.</li>

<li>If a localized entry exists in the LDAP and it matches the user's locale,
for example: entry cn;lang-fr exists and user has French locale, it will use
this entry. It first converts from LDAP's UTF8 to the charset used in
Squirrelmail, using mb_string_convert() or recode() or iconv(), whichever is
available.</li>

<li>User can ask for many criteria to be ANDed in the search.</li>

<li>Can use an administrator-supplied bind dn &amp; password.</li>

<li>uses makeComposeLink() for the mailto: hyperlinks. (Requires Squirrelmail
1.4.2)

<li>Can display alternate mail addresses if they exist on user's LDAP object.

<li>Looks really nice, with Squirrelmail colors and tables.

</ul>
