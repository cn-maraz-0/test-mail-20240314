<h1>Directory Service</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a web application for searching people in an LDAP Directory. It is
mostly suited for academic institutions that have implemented <a
href="http://www.educause.edu/eduperson">eduPerson schema</a> per <a
href="http://www.educause.edu">Educause</a> and <a
href="http://middleware.internet2.edu/">Internet2</a>. However, this is not a
requirement; only features such as browsing of an Organizational Tree will be
missed.</p>

<p>It was written for the needs of the <a href="http://www.uoa.gr">National
&amp; Kapodistrian University of Athens</a>, but can easily be adapted for
organizations or companies, especially if the eduPerson schema is involved.</p>

<p><strong>The Directory Service application can work in both standalone mode
and inside Squirrelmail, as a plugin.</strong></p>

<p>The code can be considered beta. Everything is not yet 100% complete. See
the <a href="todo.php">TODO List</a>.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>

<li>Squirrelmail 1.4.x compatibility, guidelines compatible.</li>

<li>A page that displays information about an organizational unit.</li>

<li>A page that displays a user's profile, with all the permitted
attributes.</li>

<li>Simple and Advanced Search modes.</li>

<li>Browser of an organizational tree, that has been created automagically by
eduOrgSuperiorUri attribute.</li>

<li>Sending of vCard to browser, for browsers and/or MUAs that probably support
this format.</li>

<li>Supports a 'privacy' attribute, allowing attributes to be considered as
private by the user and thus not shown in White Pages directories.</li>

<li>Edit Profile page, that allows an other set of attributes to be edited
freely.</li>

<li>Administrative Helper Pages: Edit of eduOrg information helper form +
Privacy Policy Helper Table, which will allow someone to make decisions for
privacy matters.</li>

<li>The application's LDAP Schemas, holding definitions and descriptions of the
various attributes, are stored in separate files and can be extended
easily.</li>

<li>Supports the eduOrg and eduPerson schemas, as defined by the Internet2
Middleware, Architecture Committee, Directory Working Group (MACE-Dir).</li>
 
<li>A tree of Organizational Units (eduOrg) is cached in the session.</li>

<li>User can place a restriction filter: the result must belong to the
organizational unit(s) selected by the user.</li>

<li>Interacts with Squirrelmail's Compose page, in a manner similar to the one
of the Squirrelmail Addressbook; that is, it has hyperlinks to add an email
address to To:, Cc: and Bcc: fields in the compose window.</li>

<li> Supports some kind of interoperability with the <a
href="http://email.uoa.gr/projects/squirrelmail/useracl.php">Shared Folders
(useracl) plugin</a> for Squirrelmail: can display a direct link from the
directory search results, to add a share to a particular user.</li>

<li>Adds an option in config.php for the maximum number of results that the
LDAP server will return. If there are more than the maximum results, a nice
message is being displayed.</li>

<li>Localizable / i18n - enabled.</li>

<li>If a localized entry exists in the LDAP and it matches the user's locale,
for example: entry cn;lang-fr exists and user has French locale, it will use
this entry. It first converts from LDAP's UTF8 to the charset used in
Squirrelmail, using mb_string_convert() or recode() or iconv(), whichever is
available.</li>

<li>User can ask for many criteria to be ANDed in the search.</li>

<li>Can use an administrator-supplied bind dn &amp; password.</li>

<li>uses makeComposeLink() for the mailto: hyperlinks. (Requires Squirrelmail
1.4.2)</li>

<li>Can display alternate mail addresses if they exist on user's LDAP
object.</li>

<li>Looks really nice, with Squirrelmail colors and tables.</li>

</ul>
