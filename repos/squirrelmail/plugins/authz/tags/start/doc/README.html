<h2>&quot;authz&quot;: Authorization Plugin for Squirrelmail</h2>

<p>The &quot;authz&quot; plugin for Squirrelmail allows users and/or administrators to login
to their IMAP servers via Squirrelmail, whilst using different authentication and authorization
identifiers. This allows users and/or administrators to &quot;proxy&quot; as other users.</p>

<p>Possible uses for this feature include:</p>

<ul>
        <li>Administrators logging in on behalf of users, in order to
        troubleshoot webmail problems.</li>

        <li>Administrators, performing some administrative tasks via a web
        front end rather than command line tools such as Cyrus'
        <tt>cyradm</tt>.</li>
        
        <li>Helpdesk staff, logging in as users in order to troubleshoot
        problems with them or provide help and guidance, without asking users
        for their passwords over the phone.</li>

        <li>Users proxying as other users, where appropriate and allowed. For
        instance, a company CEO's secretary can log in with her password and
        proxy as the CEO, in order to manage his email.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to use authz plugin, an IMAP server that allows proxy
authentication via SASL and supports login mechanisms other than LOGIN is
required. Any SASL mechanism other than LOGIN will do, such as PLAIN,
DIGEST-MD5, CRAM-MD5.</p>


<h2>Implementation in Squirrelmail</h2>

<p>When enabling the authz plugin in Squirrelmail, the login procedure will be
different in that a delimiter, by default the character '<strong>:</strong>'
will be searched for in the login box.</p>

<p>Therefore, if a user or administrator is aware of the proxy feature, she can
login as <tt>cyrusadmin:user</tt>, where cyrusadmin is the authorization identity
(<em>authz</em>) and user is the authentication identity (<em>authc</em>).</p>

<p>The password entered must be the one that belongs to the <tt>cyrusadmin</tt>
account.</p>

<p>If the password is correct, the webmail session will start and everything
will behave as if the account of <tt>user</tt> had logged in.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul>
        <li>Not all IMAP servers support proxy login mechanisms. An example of
        a server that does support it is Cyrus IMAPd.</li>

        <li>Even if the server supports proxy / authorized login, often it is
        not flexible enough in order to implement scenarios such as the ones
        described in this document. For instance, Cyrus IMAPd allows to define
        administrator accounts that can authorize as every other user of the
        system, but does not help impose further restrictions (for instance,
        user foo only being able to authorize as one of the users bar and
        baz). It is expected that, in the future, mail servers and
        authentication / authorization frameworks will be more flexible and
        thus allow such usage.</li>
