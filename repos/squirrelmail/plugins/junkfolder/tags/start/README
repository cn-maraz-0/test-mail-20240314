Purpose: Mark a Junk Folder as special, and display a message in that folder
for its purpose. Also allow user to create easily this folder.

The Junk Folder Plugin can allow the user to easily create a junk folder, with
a click on a button in the Folders page. Of course, you can set your autocreate
configuration on Cyrus to automatically create that folder and subscribe the
user to it too.

Junk Folder plugin does not handle the automatic purging itself; you must
configure your IMAP server to do so.  See ipurge(8) of the Cyrus IMAP
distribution for more information on how to set up automatic purging after a
given period on Cyrus.

The plugin is localizable. You can send me a translation of the plugin's
messages to your own language and they will be included in the next release.
