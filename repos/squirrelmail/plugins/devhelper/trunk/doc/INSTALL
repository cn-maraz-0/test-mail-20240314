Installing for the first time
-----------------------------

1) Untar the plugin under the squirrelmail/plugins directory. You probably have
already done this. :)

2) Copy config/config_sample.php to config/config.php. Edit config.php to your
preferences.  The file is self-documented with comments.

The defaults are OK for most installations.


Upgrading versions
------------------

1) Move the old devhelper directory aside:
   mv devhelper devhelper-prev

2) Untar the new version.

3) Check the documentation (doc/CHANGELOG.html) if there are any new configuration
   options.

4) Copy your previous configuration file:
   cp ../devhelper-prev/config.php ./config/

5) You can also try a diff with the sample configuration file, if there are any
   changes:
   vim -d config_sample.php config.php

6) If you have written any tests by yourself, copy them over to the new devhelper
   directory.
   
If and only if you are positive that things work as before (or, even, better),
then delete the old directory!
