<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> &quot;DevHelper&quot; is a simple Squirrelmail plugin that intends to aid
the Squirrelmail core or plugin developer.</p>

<p>The features and functionality are summarized as follows:</p>

<ul>
        <li>Variable dump shows the various session variables, such as cached
        preferences, mailbox lists and namespace information, that are
        available at any time during a session.</p>

        <li>Test framework, which allows developers to issue commands and
        display the result.</li>

        <li>Bundling with the SimpleTest Unit Test framework, which allows
        programmers to construct automated tests and reports, by issuing the
        proper assertions.</p>

        <li>A toolbox with forms for some handy encoding or automated
        operations; possibly needed for manual tests when using telnet to issue
        commands to the IMAP server.</li>

</ul>

<p>The DevHelper plugin is a work in progress; the actual tests might not be
available right now, but can be written when the need arises by Squirrelmail
core or plugin developers.</p>


<p>Any ideas and contributions for DevHelper are welcome by the author. Please
communicate these over to the Squirrelmail-Plugins mailing list.</p>
