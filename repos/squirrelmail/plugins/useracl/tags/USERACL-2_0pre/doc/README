                        UserACL Plugin for Squirrelmail

Introduction

   This plugin provides Squirrelmail with the functionality of Access
   Control Lists (ACLs) aka Permissions per User, that is available in
   many modern IMAP servers, the most popular open-source one being Cyrus
   IMAP.

   ACLs allow you to declare such things as:
     * "I Allow user bar to view the contents of my folder INBOX.Work."
     * "I Allow users bar and taz to write (append) to the contents of
       the folder INBOX.OurSharedFolder."
     * "I Allow user bar full rights (read, write & delete) in the
       contents of the folder INBOX.foo."

   ...et cetera.

   The user that you allow the those rights to, will see your folder
   INBOX.foo, assuming your username is foobar, as "user.foobar.foo", in
   normal namespace, or "Other Users.foobar.foo" in Alternate Namespace.

Features

     * Optionally email a notification about the changes in permissions
       to the target user.
     * Can interact with the [1]Directory Service plugin. (Display search
       form to directory service, or the directory search page displaying
       a link back to useracl form).
     * Can display the real names of the users together with their IDs,
       taken from an LDAP server.
     * Can check for the existence of a user in an LDAP directory before
       adding a permission.

Requirements

   The only requirement is an IMAP server that supports the IMAP ACL
   extension.

   The only tested IMAP server at the moment is Cyrus IMAP.

   This plugin has been based on some of the functionality - and code -
   of the [2]Cyrusmaster project.
