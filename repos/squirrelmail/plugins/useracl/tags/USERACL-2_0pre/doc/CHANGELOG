  2.0pre (9/8/2004)

     * The logic of the GUI has been changed. Instead of radio buttons,
       there are now checkboxes, and a user can choose any combination of
       the available permissions.
     * The admin permission has been added.
     * Added help tooltip in username input box.
     * Fixed locale textdomain problem in addacl popup window.
     * Update Single and Update All complexity is gone -- there is now
       just a single Update submit button.
     * Bugfix: Page header link should not include target - makes useracl
       work with multiple windows.
     * PHPDocumentor-compatible code documentation.

  1.2 (16/3/2004)

     * Now uses sqimap_run_command() instead of sqimap_read_data() -
       compatible with Squirrelmail-DEVEL (1.5).
     * Fixed typo in useracl.php (Jiri Demel)
     * Added German translation (Ulrich Abend)
     * Added Czech translation (Jiri Demel)

  1.1 (16/2/2004)

     * Folders where user has no admin permission at all are not being
       displayed any more.
     * Bugfix: Add User button, when using icons, now works.
     * Mail Notification was not sent for the last occurence of a user
       who was removed (if using LDAP). Fixed.
     * Bugfix: Mail Identities should now work correctly.
     * No requirement on directory plugin when using LDAP feature for
       names & email addresses.
     * Bugfix: checks on flags and permissions of existing folders are
       now done properly.
     * Anything other than Cyrus' normal namespace, such as Cyrus
       alternate namespace, should now work and useracl should display
       the folders. A new config option allows this ($useracl_only_inbox
       = false; , by default).

  1.0 (1/2/2004)

     * Added Search for User functionality (linking to [1]directory
       services plugin, a Squirrelmail plugin that implements LDAP
       directory search, with javascript)
     * Added Email Notification functionality; useracl can now send an
       email to the 'recipient' of the ACL, to notify her of the changes
       in her permissions.
     * Update all == adds new username as well
     * Added icons in the user interface, which can enabled optionally.
     * Fixed miscellaneous bugs.
     * Implemented 'addacl' link from Directory Result search page.
       (Experimental)
     * Plugin is now up to current Squirrelmail standards - small and
       fast setup.php, versioning information.

  0.9 (19/11/2003)

     * Initial Version.
