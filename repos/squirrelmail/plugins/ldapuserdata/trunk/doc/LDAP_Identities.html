<h2>LDAP Identities</h2>

<p>Before moving on and enabling the LDAP-based Identities feature of this
plugin, please read some information about the <a
href="http://email.uoa.gr/projects/sendmail/repfilter/index.php">Repfilter
Sendmail Milter</a> and its <a
href="http://email.uoa.gr/projects/sendmail/repfilter/design.php">design</a>.</p>

<p>If you'd like to use LDAP identities, then you can try using the supplied
Personal Options patch. This will patch the file include/options/personal.php
and change the link that points to Squirrelmail's &quot;Advanced
Identities&quot;, to the one provided by this plugin.</p>

<p>The new identities screen will then display the available email addresses
from LDAP, as described <a
href="http://email.uoa.gr/projects/sendmail/repfilter/design.php">in this
design</a>.</p>


<p>This patch and LDAP Identities scheme originates from a customized
environment, intended for the <a href="http://email.uoa.gr">University of
Athens Email Project</a>. It released in the hope that it could be useful to
someone. It makes a fine complement to the <a
href="http://email.uoa.gr/projects/sendmail/repfilter/index.php">Repfilter
Sendmail Milter</a>.</p>
