<h2>Changelog</h2>


<h3>0.5cvs</h3>

<ul>

<li>Cleaner implementation; does not need much fiddling with Squirrelmail's
files.</li>

<li>Squirrelmail schema has been updated. Specifically:

<ul>
<li>Newmail plugin configuration added to attributes</li>
<li>Added composeWindowType to attributes, for html_mail plugin
configuration.</li>
<li>The highlight preferences are now a single-value attribute which is
produced by serialization of the relevant Squirrelmail variables.</li>
<li>POP Fetch variables are also serialized, which will result in less
corrupted data being saved and read back.</li>
<li>Official, registered to IANA, unique OIDs are used instead of the temporary
random ones.</li>
</ul>

</li>

<li>Now takes under consideration mailAuthorizedAddress, as well as the
previously supported mailAlternateAddress, for the LDAP identities.</li>

<li>LDAP Identities code bundled with the plugin.</li>

<li>Code has been split up to different files, so that setup.php will be
lighter, for better performance.</li>

<li>Usage of phpdocumentor for code documentation.</li>

<li>Fixed bug where Trash, Sent and Draft folders were not handled as special
folders when not defined explicitly in a user's schema.</li>

<li>New option to support imapproxy connections; ldapuserdata can map different
IMAP servers to different imapproxy daemons</li>

<li>Supports the proxy authorization plugin (still to be released, as of this
document's release).</li>
