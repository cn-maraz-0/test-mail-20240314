<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>

<li>Squirrelmail <strong>1.4.0</strong> or greater. (Squirrelmail 1.2.x users
can use version 0.2).</li>

<li>Working Squirrelmail setup (meaning <a
"http://www.squirrelmail.org/wiki/SquirrelMailRequirements">its
requirements</a> are sufficed.</li>

<li>Working LDAP Server. Tested with <a
href="http://www.openldap.org">OpenLDAP</a>.  </ul>

</li>



<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Word of warning: This is one of them <em>intrusive plugins</em>, in that
you'll have to change some Squirrelmail code.</p>


<h3>Squirrelmail Preparation</h3>

<ul>
<li>Untar the distribution under the plugins directory of your Squirrelmail. You
probably have already done this...</li>

<li>If you are using Squirrelmail version 1.4.2 or previous, you must apply a
small patch to the functions/prefs.php file:</li>

<code>
cd /var/www/squirrelmail/functions<br/>
patch -p0 &lt; ../plugins/ldapuserdata/doc/prefs.php.diff
</code>

<li>Edit Squirrelmail's config/config_local.php and add this line:</li>

<code>
$prefs_backend = 'ldap';
</code>

<li>Optional: Occasionally people on the Squirrelmail-devel mailing list have
complained that there are too many options in the various options screens, and
this is against usability and user-friendliness. Since part of the concept was
to cut down on options anyway, you can also remove, i.e. comment-out, the
options that are not used, in the files include/options/*.php. This will make
these screens lighter and provide only the preferences that will be saved
across sessions.<br /><br />
The relevant files are provided here, if you wish to use the exact, provided
schema.<br /><br />
So, you can substitute the original <strong>include/options/*.php</strong>
files with the ones provided in the directory options_screens; their purpose is
to <strong>remove</strong> the functionality that is available to the user by
removing the options that are not saved in LDAP.</li>

</ul>



<h3>OpenLDAP Preparation</h3>

<ul>

<li>Add squirrelmail.schema to your LDAP server. The file provided in
doc/squirrelmail.schema is suitable for at least OpenLDAP 2.1.x. For
information on how to add the schema, please consult the
documenation of your LDAP server.</li>

<li>Optionally, add a squirrelmail virtual user with read-only access in your
LDAP tree. This is configurable in config.php. You can bind as Manager all the
time and do the work; however, this is not a good practice, and the best thing
would be to have a separate squirrelmail virtual user and the appropriate ACLs.
There is also a need for an account with write access; this account must be
able to write the Squirrelmail attributes, as well as update the user's
objectClass.</li>

</ul>


<h3>LDAPuserdata Plugin configuration</h3>

<ul>
<li>Copy config_sample.php to config.php and edit accordingly to suit your
preferences. The file is self-commented.<br /><br />
Remember that for all variables, even those that are not part of the LDAP
schema, you can always provide resonable and nice defaults in the
$prefs_default array.</li>

</ul>




<h3>Advanced Configuration</h3>


<ul>
<li>If you need to define different IMAP servers for each user in LDAP, then
you are probably using something like the schema of Perdition, which holds
attributes for the user's mailhost. In that case, in your Squirrelmail
configuration, you can set the IMAP server address to be
<strong>'map:ldapuserdata_get_imapserveraddress'</strong>, i.e.:
<tt>$imapServerAddress = 'map:ldapuserdata_get_imapserveraddress';</tt> </li>


<li>If you'd like to use LDAP identities, then you can try using the supplied
options_identities file. This file will replace the identities screen with one
that displays the available email addresses from LDAP. You will also need to
patch compose.php. These patches are provided with <strong>even less warranty than the
rest of the plugin</strong> (which comes with no warranty as stated in the
GPL!), as they come from a customized environment, and are only released in the
hope that they could be useful to someone.</li>

</ul>

<p>Good luck... There might be some things I've left out, so please email
squirrelmail-plugins list with questions. Feel free to Cc: me anyway so as to
grab my attention. (<strong>Do</strong> read this manual first!).</p>
