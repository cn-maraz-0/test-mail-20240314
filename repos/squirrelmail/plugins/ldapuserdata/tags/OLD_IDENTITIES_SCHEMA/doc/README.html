<h1><em>ldapuserdata</em> plugin for Squirrelmail</h1>

<div style="text-align: center">
<p><small>Based on the <a href="http://www.squirrelmail.org">SquirrelMail</a> <a
href="http://www.squirrelmail.org/plugin_view.php?id=11">Retrieve User Data
Plugin</a> (0.4/0.5)<br /> by <strong>Ralf
Kraudelt</strong> (kraude at wiwi.uni-rostock.de)</p></small></div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Originally there were two preferences backend stores for Squirrelmail: the
standard backend stores users' profile/preferences in text files
(file_prefs.php), and the MySQL one stores them in a MySQL database
(db_prefs.php).</p>

<p>This plugin adds an <strong>LDAP backend</strong>. However, things are
treated much differently, due to the difference in nature between LDAP and
other databases. Namely: LDAP writes are expensive. Extensive caching is used
to reduce the overhead on the LDAP server, especially in a setup with a lot of
users.</p>

<p>This makes a big difference, from the user's point of view. Whenever
changing some option, the change is for the current session only. The change
will only be saved permanently, if and only if the user logs out from
Squirrelmail, thus ending the session.</p>

<p>If having automatically saved preferences is important, then this plugin
might not be for you. (Or you can modify setPref() to write back the changes to
LDAP immediately and be prepared for a heavy loaded LDAP server).</p>

<p>Why put the user's profile in LDAP, in the first place? Centralization.
There is a centralized store for preferences. If you have multiple webmail
machines, they all get the same preferences for each user (one can achieve this
with the MySQL backend too). No need for NFS'ing the data directory. Also, if
you use LDAP, you connect to the Directory server anyway, to get the cn (real
name), mail (email address) and possibly mailHost (IMAP server address to
connect to).  Even if there are applications other than squirrelmail that need
this data in the future, they can get them. Last but not least, the complexity
is reduced in that a single database is used; no other text files nor MySQL
databases that all have some common information with LDAP.</p>

<p>Here's a poor attempt for a block diagram of what happens behind the
curtains:</p>

<h3>Things to Note</h3>

<p>Note that there are some issues that should be taken into consideration when
using <em>ldapuserdata</em>.</p>


<ul>

<li><strong>New/other plugins cannot just add preference variables and
<em>expect these to be saved</em></strong>. As long as they are not in the
schema, they will only survive for the current user session and will be lost
when the user logs out.</li>

<li>Some preferences have been changed: specifically some options that we don't
intend to allow changing, are not saved. <strong>Our include/options/*.php have
been modified to show these changes</strong>. And yes, this is a feature.
<em>ldapuserdata</em> is intended for a fully scalable mail system that will
accomodate thousands of users.</li>

</ul>


<h2>Other Plugins of Interest</h2>

<p>The ldapuserdata plugin itself was originally based on <a
href="mailto:kraude&#64;wiwi.uni-rostock.de">Ralf Kraudelt</a>'s retrieveuserdata
plugin (v0.4).</p>

<p>If you are looking for a solution based on MySQL, use the MySQL
backend for Squirrelmail and additionally the MySQL module from
retrieveuserdata.</p>

<p>If you are just interested in getting the Name and Email address for an
account from LDAP, just use retrieveuserdata.</p>

<p>However, if you are interested in storing the user's preferences in an LDAP
Directory, as well as authenticating the user to the Directory, this plugin
might be what you were looking for.</p>




<h2>TODO</h2>

<ul>

<li>Think of a nice algorithm that saves the preferences occasionally, esp.
when it is needed. This will raise the usability of this plugin very much. For
instance, it can be made to save the changes to LDAP whenever a submit button
from the preferences screens is pressed.</li>

<li><em>More</em> beta testing!</li>
</ul>
