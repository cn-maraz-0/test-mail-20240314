  0.5cvs

     * Cleaner implementation; does not need much fiddling with
       Squirrelmail's files.
     * Squirrelmail schema has been updated. Specifically:
          + Newmail plugin configuration added to attributes
          + Added composeWindowType to attributes, for html_mail plugin
            configuration.
          + The highlight preferences are now a single-value attribute
            which is produced by serialization of the relevant
            Squirrelmail variables.
          + POP Fetch variables are also serialized, which will result in
            less corrupted data being saved and read back.
          + Official, registered to IANA, unique OIDs are used instead of
            the temporary random ones.
     * Now takes under consideration mailAuthorizedAddress, as well as
       the previously supported mailAlternateAddress, for the LDAP
       identities.
     * LDAP Identities code bundled with the plugin.
     * Code has been split up to different files, so that setup.php will
       be lighter, for better performance.
     * Usage of phpdocumentor for code documentation.
     * Fixed bug where Trash, Sent and Draft folders were not handled as
       special folders when not defined explicitly in a user's schema.
     * New option to support imapproxy connections; ldapuserdata can map
       different IMAP servers to different imapproxy daemons
     * Supports the proxy authorization plugin (still to be released, as
       of this document's release).
     * Brought up to Squirrelmail plugin standards.
     * Documentation and installation instructions largely updated.
     * Lots of cleanups and E_ALL fixes.

  0.4

     * register_globals = off compatible
     * error_reporting = E_ALL compatible
     * New option needed in the Squirrelmail configuration: set the IMAP
       server address to be 'map:ldapuserdata_get_imapserveraddress',
       i.e.: $imapServerAddress =
       'map:ldapuserdata_get_imapserveraddress';
     * Small fixes in the supplied config_sample.php.
     * New schema for OpenLDAP 2.1.x is provided.

  0.3

     * Works with Squirrelmail 1.4.x. (Uses SM_PATH et al).
     * Various minor bugfixes and cleanups.

  0.2

     * Updated the LDAP schema.
     * Bugfix: Server side sorting is broken without a 'sort' attribute.
     * Bugfix: Fixed some variable names.
     * Bugfix: Now the special folders behave more correctly, as the
       appropriate attributes (move_to_trash, move_to_sent, save_as_draft
       are used).
     * The Options/Identities screen has been improved very much upon.
     * Added the new options screens, based on an early Squirrelmail
       1.3.0 CVS.
     * Supports the mailalternateaddress and mailauthorizedaddress LDAP
       multivalue attributes, for an easy way to support different
       "identities".
     * Now allows the POP Fetch plugin attributes to be saved on the
       LDAP.

  0.1

     * First public release.
